We tend to think of postcodes as boring things that don't change much. It turns out that there has been a large growth in the number of active postcodes over the last 40 years, as this chart shows:

<a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/46-postcodes-interactive.html"><img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/46-postcodes.svg" alt="Postcodes"/></a>

(The [interactive version]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/46-postcodes-interactive.html) allows you to hover to get information about the postcode area.)

The area with the largest number of postcodes is [BT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_postcode_area) (Belfast), which covers all of Northern Ireland, and which overtook the next largest, [B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_postcode_area) (Birmingham), in the 1990s. The one with the smallest number is GIR, a non-geographic code for Girobank. [ZE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZE_postcode_area) (Lerwick) in Shetland is the geographic area with the smallest number of postcodes.

There are some interesting things buried in the data that this visualization brings out (click on the [interactive version]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/46-postcodes-interactive.html) to see for yourself).

* In 1999, postcodes for the Wirral Peninsula that previously were in the [L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_postcode_area) (Liverpool) postcode area were transferred to the [CH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CH_postcode_area) (Cheshire) area. The jumps for both these areas are very visible on the chart.
* There are other jumps in the chart that are less easy to explain. In [BS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BS_postcode_area) (Bristol) in 1997 the number drops dramatically for a few months, before coming back to about its previous level. According to the data, over 8000 postcodes were changed in August 1997 and in December 1997, but I can't find any external reference to this change. It could be that it's an administrative artifact, a blip that doesn't mean this number of postcodes were actually removed, just that the change was spread over two separate entries. (This is just speculation though, and I could be wrong about this.)
* NPT was a non-standard area code for Newport ([NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_postcode_area)) (since it had no district number) that was phased out in 1984. (Oddly, there doesn't seem to be a corresponding jump in NP.)

It's to be expected that when new houses are built more postcodes will be allocated, but there's actually a lot more change happening than that. The chart doesn't show it (except for a few examples like Bristol above) - but there is also a significant amount of _recoding within an area_ - when a large number of postcodes are changed even though the number stays about the same.

For example, in Aberdeen ([AB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_postcode_area)) in August 1990 the area was completely [recoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AB_postcode_area#Coverage), by changing the district number from 1 digit to 2 digit codes (so, for example, [AB1 changed to AB1x](http://www.geograph.org.uk/article/Postal-address-history-and-photo-album/3#ab)). This change is not visible on the chart.

I spent longer than usual trying to come up with a postcode visualization. I wanted to do something that wasn't just showing postcodes on a map - something more about the coding system itself, ideally. One early attempt was a [sunburst diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sunburst), but the sheer number of postcode areas and districts meant that it was a blur and conveyed very little information.

I think it would be interesting to visualize postcode density - [HS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HS_postcode_area) (Hebrides) has very few postcodes over a large area, while cities like Birmingham ([B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_postcode_area)) have a large number of postcodes concentrated in a relatively small area. Or perhaps area names that are most out of proportion to the size of the area they cover - some cases include [SY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SY_postcode_area) (Shrewsbury) that extends all the way to the coast of Wales, or the small town of Llandudno that gives its name to the [LL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_postcode_area) postcode area that covers much of north Wales.

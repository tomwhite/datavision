I was [diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes](http://tom-e-white.com/2018/04/type-1-diabetes.html) two years ago, and one of the hardest adjustments has been the need to figure out the amount of carbohydrate in everything I am about to eat, so I can take the right amount of insulin to cover it.

Over time I have built a mental model of the carbohydrate content of common foodstuffs, so I decided to create a chart to make that model even clearer. It's the kind of thing I wish I'd had when I was diagnosed.

The data comes from Public Health England's [Composition of foods integrated dataset](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/composition-of-foods-integrated-dataset-cofid), although I have heavily curated the data to remove foods that are very similar, processed foods (this is intended to be a picture of simple raw foods), and food that I don't eat. The dataset has also been influenced by other work I've done to [automate carb counting from recipes](https://github.com/tomwhite/ingreedy-js).

Given the number of points on the chart it quickly became clear that it was not feasible to label them all. So I compromised by labelling only those foods that have more than 10g of carbs per 100g. The others can be identified by hovering over them with the mouse (on the [interactive version]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/23-food-carbs-interactive.html)). I think this hybrid scheme works well, as you don't have to spend your time hovering over all the high carb foods to see what they are.

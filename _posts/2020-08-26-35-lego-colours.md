The lego bricks I played with in the 70's only came in a handful of colours. Transparent yellow bricks were only introduced in 1978, for example.

Then, in the 90's there was an explosion of new colours, although many were short-lived.

This visualization shows the years when each lego brick colour was manufactured:

The [interactive version]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/35-lego-colours-iteractive.html) shows the names of each colour brick, and information about dates.

The number of [food parcels](https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-help/emergency-food/food-parcel/) distributed by food banks in the UK has grown rapidly over the last decade. The following visualization shows data from the Trussell Trust (so it doesn't include all food banks in the UK):

There is some evidence that increasing usage of food banks is [linked to austerity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_government_austerity_programme#Food_banks).

The latest data is up to the end of March 2020, so it doesn't include the impact of the coronavirus pandemic,
which is [forecast to result in a 61% increase in food parcels needed across the UK](https://www.trusselltrust.org/2020/09/14/new-report-reveals-how-coronavirus-has-affected-food-bank-use/).

This time of year is particularly difficult for users of food banks, so please consider [donating](https://www.trusselltrust.org/make-a-donation/) if you can. Thank you.

CO2 emissions in the UK have been declining since they peaked in 1971.

The [interactive version]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/31-carbon-mountain-interactive.html) shows you when emissions were below the level for a given year. For example, the last time emissions were at 2017 levels (the latest year for which we have data) was 91 years before, in 1926. (1926 was the year of the general strike in the UK. If we ignore that year the last time emissions were at 2017 levels was in the late 1890s.)

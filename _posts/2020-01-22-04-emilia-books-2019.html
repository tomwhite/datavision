      My daughter Emilia kept a record of all the books she read in 2019. She goes to sixth form
      college on the train, and has become a voracious reader partly as a result of all the commuting.
      She read 62 books overall in the year, of which 31 - exactly half - were fiction.
    </p>

    <p>
      This visualization shows her reading progress over the year. Each book is represented as a rectangle;
      blue for fiction, and green for non-fiction.
      You can see which books she spent more time on, and which books were longer books (with more pages).
      Perhaps unsurprisingly she read fiction books at a faster rate on average than non-fiction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Originally I planned on a simple line chart that showed the pages read over time. But there were several
      periods when she was reading multiple books at once (in early August, for example), so I had to break
      the line into multiple pieces, resulting in a discontinuous effect.

    <p>Since there is a lot of fine detail, it may be useful to look at a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/04-emilia-books-2019-standalone.html">standalone version</a>.</p>

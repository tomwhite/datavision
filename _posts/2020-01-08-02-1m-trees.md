In December last year a project was announced to plant one million trees in the
[Brecon Beacons National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecon_Beacons), which
is where I live.
I wondered, how much land would one million trees take up? Assuming 2250 trees per hectare, it works out at just over 4 square kilometres, which is a tiny fraction of the park. I made this map to illustrate:

<div id="mapid" style="height: 500px; width: 800px;"></div>
